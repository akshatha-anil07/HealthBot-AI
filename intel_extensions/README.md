# To run this project, you need to install the following Python packages to enable Intel Extensions
- pip install --upgrade numpy
- pip uninstall scikit-learn-intelex daal4py -y
- pip install scikit-learn-intelex daal4py
- pip install modin[all]

# Usage
- To run the chatbot, execute the following command:
      python chatbot.py
- Intel extensions will be enables and a Local Ray instance will be started

- Input the symptoms you are experiencing, and the chatbot will provide potential diagnoses along with precautionary measures.

## Why Intel Tools?
Intel extensions like Scikit-learnex and Modin significantly enhance performance compared to standard libraries, achieving speedups of 2-5 times for machine learning tasks, particularly with larger datasets. Modinâ€™s ability to scale seamlessly from single machines to clusters allows for processing of datasets larger while reducing execution times by approximately 30% relative to standard Pandas library. This combination of rapid processing, scalability, and ease of use makes Intel extensions an ideal choice for applications that demand efficient and timely data insights.
